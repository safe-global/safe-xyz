Integrated with our integration of SAFE (Arugus), it offers on-chain monitoring and analytics tailored for DeFi, enabling users to track asset movements, liquidity positions, and other critical blockchain events across multiple protocols. Together, Cobo Safe and Argus enhance security and operational transparency, making them ideal for institutional investors and custodians in the DeFi space.","project_scope":"Safe Apps","primary_category":"Infrastructure","secondary_categories":"Automation, DAO Tooling, DeFi, Governance, Institutional, SAFE, Tooling","logo":"/logos/cobo.png","value_prop":"Smart Accounts in DeFi are advanced accounts that automate and manage complex transactions and interactions with smart contracts, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. They allow for programmable control over assets, enabling features like automated trading, yield farming, and conditional transfers directly from the account.\n\nFor us, Smart Accounts streamline operations by automating routine tasks, ensuring consistency, and reducing operational overhead. This leads to faster, more reliable execution of strategies, improved risk management, and better scalability as we manage increasing volumes of assets across multiple DeFi protocols. In short, Smart Accounts simplify complex DeFi operations, making them more efficient and secure.","project_website":"https://www.cobo.com/","github_dev_docs":"https://github.com/CoboGlobal/cobosafe","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Cobo_Global","primary_integration":"Core SDK, Safe Apps SDK, Safe Contracts","packages":"","modules_guards":"https://etherscan.io/address/0x7893405d9d968a4e3637897f4fd734ca59f338f6#code","safe_apps_smart":"No","networks":"Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Optimism, Polygon"},{"project":"0xNFT by Castle","description":"NFT Marketplace Aggregator: Buy, list and transfer NFTs across OpenSea and all major markets","project_scope":"Safe Apps","primary_category":"Collectibles / NFT","secondary_categories":"Marketplace","logo":"/logos/castle.png","value_prop":"","project_website":"https://castle.link/","github_dev_docs":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CastleLinkHQ","primary_integration":"Safe Apps SDK","packages":"","modules_guards":"","safe_apps_smart":"Basket experience, transaction batching, transaction queue native UI","networks":"Ethereum"},{"project":"0xPlasma Finance","description":"Your Web3 dashboard for all things DeFi and NFT","project_scope":"Safe Apps","primary_category":"DeFi","secondary_categories":"DEX, Dashboard","logo":"/logos/plasma.png","value_prop":"","project_website":"https://plasma.finance/","github_dev_docs":"","twitter":"https://twitter.com/0xPlasma","primary_integration":"Safe Apps SDK","packages":"","modules_guards":"","safe_apps_smart":"Batch transactions No need to approve token swaps: cheaper transactions","networks":"Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon"},{"project":"0xSplits","description":"Decentralized protocol for trustlessly sharing onchain income","project_scope":"Safe Apps","primary_category":"DeFi","secondary_categories":"DAO Tooling, Infrastructure","logo":"/logos/splitz0x.jpeg","value_prop":"","project_website":"https://www.0xsplits.xyz/","github_dev_docs":"https://github.com/0xSplits","twitter":"https://twitter.com/0xsplits","primary_integration":"Safe Apps SDK","packages":"","modules_guards":"","safe_apps_smart":"","networks":"Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Base, Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Optimism, Polygon"},{"project":"1inch Network","description":"The most efficient DeFi aggregator","project_scope":"Safe Apps","primary_category":"DeFi","secondary_categories":"Aggregator, DEX","logo":"/logos/1inch-token.svg","value_prop":"","project_website":"https://1inch.io/","github_dev_docs":"https://github.com/1inch","twitter":"https://twitter.com/1inch","primary_integration":"Safe Apps SDK","packages":"","modules_guards":"","safe_apps_smart":"Batch transactions.

FailSafe is designed to deal with what to date has been regarded as game-over scenarios: an attacker learns the victim wallet's private key or seed phrase, or gains an unlimited token allowance via phishing or smart contract compromise. On enrollment of an Externally Owned Address (EOA) or a wallet contract (i.e., Gnosis Safe), the FailSafe Interceptor service monitors globally pending transactions across public, private, and internal transaction streams. Once an attacker's pending transaction is detected, FailSafe submits a just-in-time counter transaction that moves the protected wallet's assets to a recovery vault before the attacker's transaction is executed. This interception is triggered via safe mode (the equivalent of a virtual transaction lock) or smart mode, which uses threat intel to intercept only if the transaction counterparty is flagged as fraudulent.","project_scope":"Safe Apps","primary_category":"Infrastructure","secondary_categories":"Infrastructure","logo":"/logos/failsafe.png","value_prop":"People who use Safe could face big risks if someone discovers their owner's private keys or tricks them into giving access to their wallets.

The core issue addressed by Mest is the difficulty in understanding transaction details due to the way Gnosis Safe executes transactions, often making it hard to discern the actual actions taken and the asset changes involved.\nMest offers a solution by parsing the execTransaction method calls within Gnosis Safe contracts to extract actionable data, counterparties, and even signer information from signatures. This allows for a deeper analysis and transformation of transaction data into human-readable forms, covering a wide range of scenarios like DEX swaps, NFT trades, bridging, lending, and more. Unlike other platforms that may not correctly interpret Safe transactions, leading to a lack of clarity on what was done and which assets were affected, Mest aims to provide a comprehensive breakdown.\nKey improvements Mest brings to the table include:\n• The ability to understand who the counterparties in a transaction are, even when they are Gnosis Safe wallets.\n• Enhanced readability by parsing and displaying the actual method called instead of a generic execTransaction.\n• Deeper transaction analysis that covers various scenarios beyond basic transfers, such as trades, liquidity actions, and more.\n• Richer counterparty metadata, including logos and identities, to better understand transaction contexts.\n• Accurate asset change analysis, as opposed to missing or incorrect information on other platforms.","project_website":"https://mest.io/","github_dev_docs":"https://github.com/mest-io","twitter":"https://x.com/mest_io","primary_integration":"Core SDK","packages":"Safe
